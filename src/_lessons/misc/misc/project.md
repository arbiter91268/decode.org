    While we can give you endless exercises to hone your programming skills, the best, and most fulfilling way to learn is to tackle a project. You can go down whatevfer road you like, but here are some options to get you started. Most of these options require a download of some sort, but if you're at Decode, the software will be on a flash drive to save time.

## The Web

    On the Decode website there are tutorials to get into making websites and web applications and there are more [everywhere](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects). The web is now the platform for developing simple applications, people don't enjoy downloading on their desktop if all they're getting is a calculator. If you have a simple idea, turn to the web first. You can even take it to the desktop with [Chrome Packaged Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html).

## Cross Platform Game Development with Flash and FlashPunk

    Flash revolutionised in browser gaming and it is still going strong. Despite it being replaced in most websites with new HTMl5 technologies, Flash still has a thriving community in gaming, just look at [Kongregate](http://kongregate.com) (most schools will probably block this).

    FlashPunk is a commonly used library to make game development in Flash really easy, and comes with a great tutorial. Just follow the instructions [this page here](http://useflashpunk.net/getting-started/setting-up-flashdevelop.html). If you can source FlashDevelop from one of us at Decode, you can just do Step 2: "Hello World" Test and then move onto the next section [here](http://useflashpunk.net/getting-started/installing-flashpunk.html). Go through the tutorial and you'll find yourself making a game with familiar parts in no time. 

### Mac OS

    FlashDevelop is only available on Windows, but if you're familiar with using another program such as Adobe Flash Builder, feel free to use FlashPunk with that.

## Android and Java Development

    You can develop on Android and Java under the same software, because they are effectively the same thing. Google bundles a software kit known as the Android SDK which is a Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment), with an Android plugin. Don't let the name Android fool you, as you can make ordinary Java applications with this as well. To get set up, just download it from here [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). The application you want is called `eclipse.exe` and is under the folder `eclipse`.

### Native Android Development

    To get started with making some Android apps, go [here](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html) and simply follow the instructions. Bear in mind that a fair bit of downloading will need to occur at first to run your first program.

### Cross Platform Games

    LibGDX is an emerging library for Java that can export to desktop (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), mobile (Android, iOS) and HTML5. It's a little harder than Flash but better on performance. There are some really good instructions for getting set up under Eclipse [here](https://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/ProjectSetupNew), and then a tutorial for making your first app [here](https://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/ProjectSetupNew).

### Plain Java

Some better tutorials are on their way for this, but you can try this rather outdated one [here](http://www.matcmp.ncc.edu/~steve/java-gui-tutorial/).

### Modding Minecraft

    Minecraft has one of the most active modding communities seen yet, and tinkering with the game is a lot of fun. Forge is a commonly used modding API and you can use it to tear right into Minecraft development. You can either follow it's neat structure (good for publishing online) or directly edit the source code (good for fun!).

    There is a [tutorial for setting up Forge and making a basic mod. Their wiki also has a lot of other tutorials for other aspects of the game.](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Generic_Mod)

## iOS and OSX Development

    Apple makes the process for developing on iOS pretty simple if you're on a Mac, otherwise the system is really quite complicated. Here, we will cover the side that requires you to own a Mac. First you will need XCode which you can get from the App Store, or if you're lazy, [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12) is a link to download. Once you've got it installed, Apple has some tutorials on how to get started on [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphone101/Articles/00_Introduction.html) and [OSX](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapOSX/books/RM_YourFirstApp_Mac/Articles/Introduction.html).
