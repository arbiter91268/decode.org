<q>Objects are so much more</q> - Kristian

We have learnt how to create classes and how to create instances of them, but there is one problem. Our class currently does not do anything. By adding fields and methods, we can 
define the state and behaviour respectively of our class, and hence make it more than just an empty file.

Before we start explaining fields though, we have to go over the different data types within the language. Come with us.
