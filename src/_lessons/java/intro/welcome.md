<q>Welcome, so glad you are accompanying us on our journey!</q> - Kristian

This expansive tutorial set covers everything a beginner or intermediate programmer needs to know about the Java programming language. Journey through 50+ tutorials
that comprehensively cover their subject in many categories with Java, including inheritance, generics, concurrency, io, and much more!

The tutorial covers features in Java as of version 1.7. There will be tutorials of features that are impending in the next update.

## What this tutorial covers

This tutorial covers a wide plethora of features and tools within the Java language. Below is a list of all of the categories.

*   Introduction to Java
*   Object orientation
*   Language structure
*   Operators
*   Control flow
*   Inheritance
*   Access Control
*   Interfaces
*   Inner classes
*   Exceptions
*   Strings
*   Generics
*   Containers
*   I/O
*   Annotations
*   Enumerated types
*   Concurrency
*   Swing library

## Tutorial structure

The tutorials are straightforward. Every new concept, topic, or tool will appear on a seperate page, but all part of the associated tutorial set. Sections of code, e.g. 
class/method/field names will be displayed as a `code` font, and keywords will appear as a bold **`code`** font. This enables you to distinguish
between normal text and sections of code for easier identification and a better understanding. These font types will pnly be used when referencing, explaining, or mentioning 
them, and not always. Otherwise it gets tedious formatting every word.

Code snippets will appear sometimes in the tutorials to give a hands-on experience on how code should be structured, etc. These code snippets can either be inline, e.g:
`print("Hello World");` or in blocks. If in blocks, the name of the file will be displayed above the code block to show you where the code is snipped from.

## Code Examples

All of the code examples in this tutorial is avaliable for download. You can view the code snippets yourself freely. Be aware though, that the code is the property of 
Decode.org and its contributor(s) and will not be maintained. You can edit the files as you please, but the files are not avaliable for commercial use. Educational use is
encouraged.

## Errors

We, at Decode try our best to make the code examples and tutorial grammar as correct and accurate as possible. We try to eliminate any bugs in the code and to give the
best explaination grammatically as possible. However some small errors can slip through. If you identify something that you think is not correct, contact us and we can fix
it.
