title: LWJGL Conclusion
---
## What have we learnt?

We have learnt how to use LWJGL to create simple, 2D games in Java. We have gone over rendering simple shapes, and making them respond to keyboard events, such as button 
presses. We have also learnt how to implement the physics of the game to make the ball rebound off walls, etc.

However we haven't learnt all there is to LWJGL - there is still lots, such as 3D games, sound, and more. Since those are rather advanced aspects of the library, we will
only cover the basics to simple 2D game making.

Thank you for taking your time to use the tutorial to educate yourself about 2D game making with Java, and on behalf of Decode, it has been fun teaching you and we hope
to see you again soon!

## Source Code

The source code and the compiled runnable JAR file for the game is up for grabs on this website. Download it below, or copy and paste the source code if you want to continue
creating the game by adding more stuff to it.

Runnable JAR File: [Pong.jar](/files/Pong.jar)

Below is the full source code of the application.

## Video

Below is a video of the game in action, so you can see what we've accomplished during the tutorial.

## Additional Tasks

Here are some additional challenges that you can do that expand upon the game. You can try them if you wish.

*   Add a score system for the game.
*   Make the game 4 player.
*   Give the player the option to choose how many people are playing.
*   Write better physics for the ball, there are some things wrong with it.
*   Try to beat my longest time playing - 3 minutes!
