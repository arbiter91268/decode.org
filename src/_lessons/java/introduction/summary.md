In summary, we now know what Java is and why many people depend upon it. Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language that is cross-platform and is used for many
basic operating systems, such as the software systems for ATMs and parking meters.

You have also learnt why Java triumphs over many other languages, such as C++. It is more user-friendly compared to many other programming languages, it is flexible, and is 
one of the easiest programming languages to learn, but without sacrificing power and usage restrictions.

We are thankful that you have decided to perform a noble task - learning Java, and we will guide you all of the way through it. This section is just the beginning.
