      <h1>Code has passed us by</h1>
      <p>And it's no secret. Technology has become something so easy to access but so easy to become a consumer of, the world has taken that mentality on. Decode, a project based in New Zealand is one that tries to reverse that mentality, empowering people with technology so that they may use it and it may not use them.</p>

      <h2>Sessions</h2>
      <p>Decode supplies a model for schools and other organisations to run sessions that allow students to explore technology in a way that they enjoy, and a way that allows them to learn a lot. You can find a local session today, or volunteer your time to make sessions better. This could be in the form of running your own sessions, or joining a current one as a mentor.</p>
