title: Run Decode
---

Decode is an open book, completely free for anyone who wants to run it. Running Decode takes the form of Decode sessions. These sessions are open and flexible and follow a series of values rather than a strict model. Here are those values:

## The students decide their course

There are countless possibilities to what could be achieved at Decode, so many potential projects. Stifling that potential to a single prescribed course is a sure fine way to stifle the interest and learning as well. For this reason, the students ultimately decide what they'll work on. They can work in groups, or alone, they can tackle massive projects or hone their knowledge on small excercises. It would be wise to give an aimless student a direction to head in. Warning should also be given to a student who is potentially tackling a problem that is too difficult for them, but they should never be outright forbidden from attempting.

## Someone has the answers

Starting is the hardest part of a journey into coding. There should be at least person in the room who can help someone start this journey, be they simply a student or someone in an official mentoring role. At the beginning of a series of Decode sessions (for example, at a school), there may only be one person available with all the answers and they should take on the role of mentor. This mentor doesn't need to know how to use every technology on the planet, but they must be well rounded in programming and know what technologies are available - setting someone up can be as simple as telling someone to search up a particular technology. If pretty much nobody in a session knows anything about coding, the first few sessions may very well have to take on more of a classroom setting so that they can get their bearings and understand exactly what power they have at their fingertips. What should happen is students attending sessions become the experts, so instead of going to one person, students can bounce around and share their knowledge between themselves.

## Anyone is welcome, no commitments

Skill level is no barrier, a total beginner is always welcome. Experts are also encouraged to come for a space where they can simply develop their skills and allow others to use their wealth of knowledge. Because this model is so flexible, there should be no problem with someone joining when sessions are well underway. There is no start or end to Decode, it simply keeps on going so if someone wants to join, let them. On the flipside, if someone thinks it just isn't for them, or if they only want to turn up every few sessions or so, they are allowed to do so. If you are tied to a particular school in your running of sessions, you will likely only serve students from that school - on the off chance that someone outside that school does want to come along - let them! The only restrictions that may be appropriate would be those of age restrictions, but these should only be used if necessary.

## Computers are cool, fun and useful

Long gone are the days of being ashamed of knowing how to use a computer well. Be passionate and spread the word far and wide, use whatever means (including our media package) to show people that computers really aren't that hard. Sessions should be kept fun as well, liven it up with a miniature competition every so often, bring along food and allow people to eat and drink in a session.

## Be revolutionary

This is experimental, no lies here. Some things are bound to go wrong and that's okay, let us know about your experiences! But through our experimentation we will find what works well and may even be able to make a big impact on education.

# Where to from here?

If you like what you see and want to be a part of this, here are the steps we want to take with you so that you get set up smoothly:

1.  You'll express interest by contacting us (there's a form at the bottom of this page). We'll organise a meeting with a Decode representative just to make sure we're all on the same page.
2.  If you're a school, it would be best to find a student to take charge. Someone who is passionate about programming and knows enough to keep Decode sessions running. This helps to make sessions more accessible for other students - there will always be at least one of these people. It may take the first couple of sessions to find out who they are.
3.  Logistically, you need to sort out a timing and venue for your sessions. This is up to the runner, but we found that weekly works quite well. If you're at a school then of course straight after school is ideal. Where you'll be attracting people that you know won't have access to their own laptops it is vital that you find a way to provide computers for them somehow.
4.  Then it's time to spread the word with whatever means you can. We have a [media package](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2XaAozFAVAZM3J3c0EyRWhRcDQ&usp=sharing) to make this process easier. It has our promotional video, generic posters, our fonts and logos and InDesign files so that you can make your own posters.
5.  Then you'll be running your sessions. Wherever possible, someone from Decode will be there to help you for the first ones so you can understand better how the model works.
6.  From there on it's yours. Feed back to us with how you feel things are going so we can improve. You'll also get access to a special teachers section in Discuss so everyone running Decode can collaborate on how to best run sessions.
